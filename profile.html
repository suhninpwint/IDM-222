            <h2> Designer | Programmer | Artist  </h2>
                <p>My name is Su Hnin Pwint and I’m from Yangon, Myanmar. I am majoring in Interactive Digital Media. I am young amateur who is passionate about technology and digital media. I have been taking courses related to design and programming since high school until now. When I don’t work on design or programming I would work on my photography skills or sew clothes for fun. Regardless of school work, I love helping the people and environment so, I would volunteer for events whenever as I am in a community service sorority. Besides, digital artwork I love working hands on such as using acrylic, water color, print-making, and charcoal when I have leisure time. I have had previous experience with web design and mobile development interning at NexLabs.co. I was to design websites from scratch and made wireframes. I also helped the front-end development building websites and learned Objective-C. I’m looking forward to become a UI and UX designer or a front-end web developer because I love design and coding at the same time I want to explore into VR and AI and want to integrate those into my projects.</p>
